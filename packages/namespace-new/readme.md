## Notes

Possible options for codegen:

- Minimize code or minimize operations. For example, it is possible to make code smaller and provide just list of codecs to tuple encode/decode. On the other side, it is possible to escape all runtime mapping and extract encoders/decoders manuallu in codegen.
