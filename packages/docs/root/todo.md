# To Do

Here are some ideas how to improve the library and "Developer eXpririence" related to its usage.

-   Rewrite compiler without Vue & Prettier and make it easy-compatible with Web (almost done)
    -   ...and create compiler's playground
-   Make encode/decode debugging easier - more descriptive errors?
